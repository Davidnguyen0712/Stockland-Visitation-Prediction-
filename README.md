The project aims to study how weather affects the number of people visiting a Stockland Asset (shopping centres) in different areas. 

- Tools used: Jupiter Notebook, Python, Streamlit, Pandas, SckitLearn, Seaborn, Maths

Also, I have deployed the data model into a web API by using Streamlit library from Python.
